# This is my first published game and it's source code
-  This was made way back in 2021 as my School Project when I was in 1st year of making Game so expect a lot of rule violations in terms of coding.
-  In terms of Asset managements or folder managemnets there will be a lot of mishaps
-  In terms of Scene Hierarchy will be complicated
-  In terms of Lightings it was my experimentation
-  Created in 2021.3.13f
# NOTE: Depsite being small scale, the project file can reach up to 3gb
